Commonly recommended best products for pregnancy are the <br\/>combination of folic acid and vitamin B1, that work synergistically for <br\/>fetal development such as cell division and the formation of the myelin <br\/>sheath or nerve covering. Another benefit is that they also prevent the <br\/>buildup of homocysteine, a toxic by-product of protein metabolism that <br\/>has been associated with birth defects.<\/p><p>Iron<br\/> is also another important factor in a baby’s development. Many of the <br\/>best natural prenatal vitamins, multivitamins & supplements also <br\/>contain iron which helps to increase blood production for the baby. But <br\/>it is important to consult a healthcare practitioner when dealing with <br\/>all natural pregnancy products. We carry a number of different mom and <br\/>baby care products such as lactation teas for healthy milk production <br\/>for the mother. The benefits are numerous when it comes to mom and baby <br\/>care products at Well Well Well. Research has shown from a 1998 study, <br\/>that a child’s risk for developing a brain tumour decreased in <br\/>connection to the number of trimesters the mother took Prenatal <br\/>multivitamin supplements during pregnancy. At Well Well Well, we also <br\/>carry a number of quality baby and kids supplements to help with your <br\/>child’s development and health.<\/p><p>Another<br\/> very important aspect for new mothers is natural skin care during <br\/>pregnancy. Making sure that skin care products are clean and non-toxic <br\/>for the mother is imperative in maintaining skin health during <br\/>pregnancy.<\/p>",
